```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is package serves to demonstrate that `devtools::test()` fails for function `master_fct2` (when the package is not installed but merely loaded with devtools), but the function runs without any problems when called by the user.

It is noteworthy that the problem appears to come from a call to `dplyr::summarize` in the worker function. `master_fct1` calls a different worker function that does not use `dplyr::summarize`, and `devtools::test()` has no problems with that function.

## devtools::test()

```{r}
tryCatch(
  expr = { devtools::test() },
  error = function(e) {
    print(conditionMessage(e))
  }
)
```

## Call function manually

```{r}
devtools::load_all()

master_fct2(5L)
```
